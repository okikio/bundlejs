// Deep Equality comparison example
//
// This is an example of how to implement an object-comparison function in 
// JavaScript (ES5+). A few points of interest here:
//
// * You can get an array of all an object's properties in ES5+ by calling
//   the class method Object.keys(obj). 
// * The function recursively calls itself in the for / in loop when it
//   compares the contents of each property
// * You can hide a "private" function inside a function of this kind by
//   placing one function declaration inside of another. The inner function
//   is not hoisted out into the global scope, so it is only visible inside
//   of the parent function.
// * The reason this nested helper function is necessary is that 
//   `typeof null` is still "object" in JS, a major "gotcha" to watch out for.
