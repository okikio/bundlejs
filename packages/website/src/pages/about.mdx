# About

**bundlejs** is a quick and easy way to bundle your projects, minify and see their gzip and brotli size. It's an online tool similar to <Anchor href="https://bundlephobia.com">bundlephobia</Anchor>, but **bundlejs** does all the bundling locally on you browser and can treeshake and bundle multiple packages (both commonjs and esm) together, all without having to install any npm packages and with typescript support.  
  

I used <Anchor href="https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor">monaco-editor</Anchor> for the code-editor, <Anchor href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild">esbuild</Anchor> as bundler and treeshaker respectively, <Anchor href="https://github.com/hazae41/denoflate">deno\_brotli</Anchor> as a wasm port of gzip, <Anchor href="https://github.com/denosaurs/deno_brotli">denoflate</Anchor> as a wasm port of brotli, <Anchor href="https://github.com/denosaurs/deno_lz4">deno\_lz4</Anchor> as a wasm port of lz4, <Anchor href="https://github.com/visionmedia/bytes.js">bytes</Anchor> to convert the compressed size to human readable values, <Anchor href="https://github.com/btd/esbuild-visualizer">esbuild-visualizer</Anchor> to visualize and analyze your esbuild bundle to see which modules are taking up space, <Anchor href="https://github.com/mikecao/umami">umami</Anchor> for private, publicly available analytics and general usage stats all without cookies, and <Anchor href="https://github.com/mlomb/countapi-js">countapi-js</Anchor> to keep track of the number of page visits, in a private and secure way.  
  
This project was greatly influenced by <Anchor href="https://github.com/hardfist">@hardfists</Anchor> <Anchor href="https://github.com/hardfist/neo-tools">neo-tools</Anchor> and <Anchor href="https://github.com/mizchi">@mizchi's</Anchor> <Anchor href="https://github.com/mizchi/uniroll">uniroll</Anchor> project.  
  

> Some of bundlejs's latest features were inspired by <Anchor href="https://github.com/egoist/play-esbuild">egoist/play-esbuild</Anchor> and <Anchor href="https://github.com/hyrious/esbuild-repl">hyrious/esbuild-repl</Anchor>, check them out they each use esbuild in different ways.

The project isn't perfect, I am still working on an autocomplete, better mobile support and the high memory usage of **esbuild** and **monaco** as well as some edge case packages, e.g. **monaco-editor.**  
  
If there is something I missed, a mistake, or a feature you would like added please create an issue or a pull request and I'll try to get to it. You can contribute to this project at <Anchor href="https://github.com/okikio/bundle">okikio/bundle.</Anchor>  
  
**bundle** uses <Anchor href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/">Conventional Commits</Anchor> as the style of commit, and the <Anchor href="http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/">Commitizen CLI</Anchor> to make commits easier.
