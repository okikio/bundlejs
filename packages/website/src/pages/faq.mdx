# FAQ

I frequently get asked what was the point in building bundlejs, this is a short, quick, and simple summary of frequently asked questions and my reasons for building bundlejs.


## What is the advantage over <Anchor href="https://bundlephobia.com">bundlephobia</Anchor>?

There are a couple reasons for this, but the main one is that `bundlephobia` wasn't reliable enough.


## What do you mean wasn't reliable enough?

Right now `bundlephobia`, is a bit hit or miss when it comes to treeshaking. So, I built **bundlejs.com**, which can treeshake bundles accurately.  
  
For example, try treeshaking the `Event` class from `@okikio/emitter` using <Anchor href="https://bundlephobia.com/package/@okikio/emitter">bundlephobia</Anchor> and try treeshaking the `Event` class using <Anchor href="/?bundle&q=@okikio/emitter&treeshake=Event">bundlejs.com</Anchor>. 

```ts
export { Event } from "@okikio/emitter"; 
``` 

will notice a major package size disparity. This is only one example and I am sure others exist, I hope the above example illustrates my point.  

Another problem with `bundlephobia` is the lack of good error reporting if (for whatever reason) `bundlephobia` isn't able to bundle your package, it logs this to the console, 

```ts
{
    "code": "BuildError",
    "message": "Failed to build this package.",
    "details": {
        "name": "BuildError"
    }
} 
```

this just isn't very useful for debugging.  


On the other hand, since, `bundlejs.com` runs locally right on your computer, when an error occurs it logs the exact error you would see when using <Anchor href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild</Anchor> or other bundlers in your build process, making it much easier to know exactly what is wrong with your js bundle.

  

## Wait, locally as in no external servers?

Yes, locally right on your browser, I used <Anchor href="https://esbuild.github.io/getting-started/#wasm">esbuild-wasm</Anchor> for the main bundler and <Anchor href="https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/">rollup</Anchor> for more accurate treeshaking.

  

## Can it bundle multiple packages and treeshake them?

Yes. `bundlejs.com` can treeshake all packages, and it can do so accurately.
